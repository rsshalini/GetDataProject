# GetDataProject
This is a course project from Getting and Cleaning Data course in Coursera. 

# Overview
This project is to create a tidy data set from messy data, that can be used later for analysis. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  A full description of how the project data source can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The data used for the project is available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). 

#Project Summary
The following tasks are expected to be carried out. 

<ol>
<li> Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. </li>
<li> Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. </li>
<li> Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. </li>
<li> Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. </li>
<li> Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. </li>
<li> From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. </li>
</ol>

#Project Files
<ul>
<li> README.md (A README file for this repo to summarise what this repo is about and what it contains.) </li>
<li> run_analysis.R (R script file that has the code to transform messy data to tidy data set) </li>
<li> CodeBook.md (A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that has been performed to clean up the data ) </li>
